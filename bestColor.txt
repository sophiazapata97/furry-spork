Grey or gray (American English alternative; see spelling differences) is an intermediate color between black and white. It is a neutral color or achromatic color, meaning literally that it is a color "without color", because it can be composed of black and white.[2] It is the color of a cloud-covered sky, of ash and of lead.

That being said, the best color is, in fact, grey.
